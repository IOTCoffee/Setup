IOT Coffee Maker! It makes coffee over the internet and if that ain't the
coolest thing you've seen all day, then idk what you're looking at, but you've
gotta show me.

SW used: Kotlin, Python. See README for detailed software list and usage.

HW Used: Raspberry Pi 3, breadboard, a relay, a couple of wires, a coffee maker

The value of the project is that it's fairly easy to set up with any hardware!
The design of the software is built with modularity in mind. It can connect to
any coffee maker securely assuming it uses the same protocol designed for this
project. 

While the software itself is single purpose, it is easy to make it so it works
with the hardware you decide to use. The only constraints are that you use a
POSIX compliant operating system on the the coffee hardware, and that it runs
Java and Python, that your remote server runs Java, and that you have a phone
that runs Android. If you have all those things, it will work flawlessly with
anything.

For install instructions, see the README!
